# 🚫 Pull Request Creation - Current Status

## ❌ Automated PR Creation Not Possible

I have completed all the enhanced form input styling work and pushed it to GitHub, but I cannot create the pull request automatically due to **authentication limitations** in this environment.

The pull request creation requires:
